Constructer--->
Multiple constructer can have with differnt signature(signature means int type, second one is string type etc)
using overloading(Overloading allows a programmer to use the same method name over and over, as long as the
signature of the method is different each time
)

The signature consists of the method name and
a parameter list


/ different parameter list
public void getCab (String cabbieName);
// different parameter list
public void getCab (int numberOfPassengers);

 -------need to see in python----------


Python does not follow overloading that what we can not declare multiple constructer;
In case if you declare it will pickup the last one
